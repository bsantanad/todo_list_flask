todo list in flask
==================

Super simple web app.

The purpose of the project is to learn flask's basics, how
does sqlachemy works and implement a login capability.

how can I run it?
=================

create virtualenv, install requirements with pip,
they are listed in requirements.txt, and run:

.. code:: bash
    (venv)% python app.py

open browser, search *localhost:5000*, you'll see the todo list,
the use is pretty intuitive

of course, if I'm learning this stuff, I'm getting it
from some place right?
